These classes are provided for demonstration purpose (and for my own practice with CS fundamentals).

I have chosen to focus on satisfying basic cases in demonstrating the fundamentals, and have chosen not to chase optomization around (i.e. a unit testing framework and handling for all possible edge cases).

Since the class files are serving as a space for a functional paradigm (rather than an object), inheritance is sometimes performed within the file itself to keep dependant ideas within a single file..
